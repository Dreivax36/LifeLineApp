# Lifeline First Upload

My First Official App Project | LifeLine App

## Project Information

COVID-19 Information System is one part of a planned Emergency Response Application called LIFELINE APP wherein it focuses with tracking the development of the COVID-19 Cases within the Philippines. 
It is planned to have a self-assessment for the purpose of checking for COVID symptoms. 
Information about COVID-19 Cases, Daily Updates, and Prevention. Hotline For COVID-19 Emergencies.



## Project Update

July 4 2020

However, due to the constraints in time, I can only do so much.
Thus here is an update.

The Homepage is only a Basic UI design. The Buttons are not yet configured to what I had designed in mind.


The Second Page, it is the main portion of the program. The Covid-19 Tracker.
The Daily Update is Working however the data available is only for the worldwide data.
Also the Switch for getting the data for the PH Cases and Global Cases are not yet configured.
Same with the Saatistical Data. There are no live data linked to the Bar Graphs.


## Notes

I opted using API right away rather than creating a local repository of data for practiallity's sake because it would be much more efficient for the system to have that API in place for the easy update of the cases.

For the CRUD requirements though, I think I have done it with the GET and POST methods as the alternative.

Overall: I have learned so much with Flutter and Dart language. Had spend a lot of time mostly on debbuging some codes since it was new to me so that is the reason I only got to make the Worldwide Data. But it was worth it.

## Future Plans

The Goal is to have the Philippine Data in an API. I dont know if I can create my Own API or search for a readily available API for the PH data. IF there is none, then will create a custom API for the Philippine Covid Updates.
